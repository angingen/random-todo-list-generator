## Random To-do List Generator

Feeling every day is the same? Do not have enough time to plan for your week? Or simply run out of idea of what to do in your free time? **The goal of this project is to design an easy to use to-do list generator that could help people to create a plan with random tasks in a click.**

`The website can be accessed [here](https://randomtodolistgenerator.herokuapp.com/).`

### This project can:
1) provide a random to-do list with tasks close to the users' preference;
2) help people who are afraid of changes to jump outside their comfort zone to try new things;
3) give inspirations to people that do not have a plan of what to do.

## Features:
### Step 1 - Select your generator type:
There are two type of generators: a single challenge for your day and a random to-do list for your week.

### Step 2 - Customize your tasks:
Set the preference of your random tasks, including the task categories and length of time. For the to-do list generator, you can include/exclude a certain date from your list as well.

### Taks Library:
You can view tasks and their descriptions based on the chosen category on the Task Library. Feel free to propose your own task by clicking the `+` button.

**More tasks will be added to the library gradually.**
